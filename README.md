PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This code will be uses Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT

Panda Script : Run WeatherPy.ipynb & vaccationPy.ipynb by activating jupyter notebook from the terminal. The ipynb file includes comments for ease of understanding. Alternatively, run WeatherPy.ipynb & vaccationPy.ipynb in visual studio to review the code and comments. Use Terminal to run the python file to see the results and review the trends observed on each findings.

Open folder Output to view the csv which contains all the cities taken for this analysis. Also few figures that show scatter plot for comparisions between northern and southern hemishpere factors.
